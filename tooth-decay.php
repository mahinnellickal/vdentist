        	<h1>Tooth Decay: Information for Prevention</h1>
            
     <p></p>       
            
          <p> For someone who brushes regularly, tooth decay comes as little to no worry but for many people whom are busy doing things they love and forget about brushing on time or forgetting to brush altogether, the issue of tooth decay poses some serious dental health risks.
Tooth decay or "dental caries" is the process of bacteria infiltrating the inner portions of the tooth, often leading to an unsightly, gaping hole in the area where the bacterial infiltration is concentrated. Tooth decay is no small issue as several deaths have been caused by tooth decay of even a single tooth. This, along with a few other cases of unsightly tooth decay instances has led the US government to pass a bill called the "Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2007," which aims to provide free dental services for children in poverty.</p>
<p>Tooth decay can be prevented by the regular brushing and flossing of teeth, combined with a dentist-recommended toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Dentists will often recommend a healthy food regimen to prevent tooth decay from occurring but people frequently violate these guidelines by consuming the flavorful, yet dentally compromising foods, that are either highly acidic or high in sucrose content (fructose, glucose and sucrose).</p>
<p>Though the recalcification or the "regeneration" of the tooth enamel is highly likely with people who brush their teeth at least thrice a week, the effects of tooth decay still vary in our bodily composition. Adults have a significantly less chance to recover from tooth decay than children and since people with a 'sweet tooth' often tend to carry that habit as they grow older, they are often people whom are more prone to acute tooth decay circumstances.</p>
<p>To prevent tooth decay and other related dental health concerns, one must always follow these simple steps and advice, ranked below by importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 - Brush and floss teeth after meals and before going to sleep each night. People with dental appliances like braces and dentures may require more thorough brushing and cleaning.</li>
<li>2 - Always bring a toothbrush and toothpaste if you're going to stay out of town for more than a day. Research demonstrates that people eat more both in quantity and variety when they are out of town in comparison to their normal daily eating patterns.</li>
<li>3 - Get your teeth cleaned at least twice a year. Professional cleaning often takes a few minutes and the costs are very reasonable. Oftentimes, your dental coverage plan will take care of 80-100% of the bill, making it common sense preventative maintenance for your oral and overall health. We also highly  recommend getting dental health insurance.</li>
<li>4 - Get dental fillings if needed and you haven't had them yet as they are one of the most important procedures that are mandatory for your teeth.</li>
<li>5 - Again, avoid foods with drastically high amounts of sugar and high acidity levels as these foods will become a dental health concern in the big picture. Also consider lessening or eliminating preservative-based foods from your diet and implement the consumption of eating natural and/or organic foods.</li>
<li>6 - In some cases, pediatric dentists may prescribe chewable sodium fluoride tablets to children and adolescents, ensuring that they receive sufficient amounts of fluoride for their teeth. These tablets are sold in bottles and usually have a higher cost than regular vitamin supplements.
</li>
            </ol>
<p>For severe cases of tooth decay, signaled by acute pain caused by a gaping hole commonly known as a "cavity," bad breath and a bitter taste when eating food, one should definitely go see a dentist.</p>
