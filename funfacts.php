        	<h1>Fun Facts About Toothpaste</h1>
            
     <p></p>       
            
        <p>  Many people aren't aware of many of the other unique ingredients contained in toothpaste gel beside fluoride. Beyond it's abundant advertising, there's a lot more to the different varieties of that crystalline gel than meets the eye which often makes it difficult for consumers to choose the best toothpaste to match their dental hygiene needs. Over the years, toothpaste has evolved from a dull, white, pasty substance to a more appealing gel, endorsed by everyone from small children to medical professionals to pro athletes in order to lure people to brush their teeth more often.</p><p>
Toothpaste does the dirty job of helping our toothbrush scrape off the bacterial films called plaque that have grabbed onto our teeth. Typical toothpaste's main agents or "active ingredients" include fluoride, baking soda, triclosan and xylitol. After a thorough brushing, the combined forces of these main ingredients give our teeth a deep clean, a white luster and a fresh feel. Additionally, over the years, more and more ingredients have been added to the usual toothpaste formula, such as allantoin, ginseng and seaweed extracts, along with a variety of herbal oils, serving a practical purpose by helping to strengthen both our tooth enamel and the gums.</p><p>
Fluoride indeed helps to strengthen our teeth and helps to eliminate bacteria-producing acids but high amounts of fluoride can actually be a detriment to our teeth. Too much fluoride intake, especially on young children below 12 years old, can cause enamel fluorosis, a condition that is recognized by discoloration on the teeth. Although too much fluoride may have its cons, the benefits outweigh the potential threats. Only a few cases of fluorosis have been recorded and fortunately, they have been mild ones at that. The fluoridation of the water supply in the United States has produced critical reviews on whether or not America needs it. However, the children apparently do need it because cases of cavities and tartar on children below 10 years old have significantly decreased in the last decade.</p><p>
Did you know that toothpastes are actually abrasive substances? Abrasive means 'intended for scraping,' so it's actually a pure cleaning material, not just some over-hyped gel that you and your family are brushing your teeth with.</p>
<p>Toothpaste comes in a variety of flavors. The once dull taste of toothpaste has evolved into something more of a treat to both young and old people. The standard flavoring of toothpaste is often of the mint variety, with spearmint and peppermint being very popular. There have also been other flavors that are intended for smaller children and people who don't enjoy the taste of mint. These include bubble gum, cinnamon, tangerine, orange, and even more risque flavors such as whiskey. Despite all these years of modifications in the flavor and ingredients, toothpaste itself has constantly improved as a whole and still serves its primary purpose of cleaning teeth, with the strength of the flavor actually masking stronger active ingredients within the gel.</p><p>
In recent years, there have been "natural toothpaste" varieties being sold in markets and a majority of these natural toothpastes abandon the use of fluoride and have maintained a consistency of only all-natural ingredients that were previously noted above, like extracts, mints, cleansing agents and oils.</p><p>
So if you're looking for a change of taste in toothpaste, we're all for it, as long as the flavor you're switching to is packed with all the active ingredients toothpaste should contain to insure teeth health.</p>
