       <h3>Sugar : </h3>
       <p>
Surprisingly, many adults seem to forget that sugar is bad for teeth. The amount of time the sugar is left on teeth is also important. Your teeth will be healthier if, for example, you eat ten sugar cookies in ten minutes and then floss and brush than if you nibble on three sugar cookies for three hours and constantly expose your teeth to sugar over a linger period of time. The same goes for sugared sodas and fruit juices as the sweet, sugary taste in your mouth could be an indicator and make you aware that cavities could be forming. </p>
<p>
Many people believe that they cannot get cavities after their teeth are capped (crowned). They are incorrect. While you cannot get a cavity through a cap itself, you can easily obtain a new cavity at the junction, or margin, where the cap ends on the outer tooth structure near the gum if you're negligent with tooth care.</p>
<h3>
Floss :</h3>
<p>
Most of the bacteria that causes cavities and gum disease collect in the spaces between teeth. If you have to choose between the two, you would actually always be better off if you only floss and never brush.
