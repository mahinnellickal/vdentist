     <p> There are several ways to make your teeth whiter; Bonding, Porcelain Veneers (Laminates), Porcelain Crowns (Caps) and Bleaching (Whitening). Bleaching involves changing the color of the teeth without changing their physical structure. An example of this would be if you put a blue shirt in Clorox bleach  it would turn white but the fabric would remain intact.</p>
<p>Home or office bleaching are the two most common ways patients can choose to bleach their teeth.   Home bleaching involves the fabrication of plastic mouthpieces that look like protective sport mouth guards with the patient needing to wear them with hydrogen peroxide-based bleach for two to four hours a day for four to eight weeks total. </p>
<p>Office bleaching is much more simple and convenient for patients though often a little more expensive. Patients typically come in for a single or a small series of several forty-five minute appointments depending upon the amount of  desired color change. The bleach is applied directly to the teeth while a lip retractor holds the lips away from the teeth and a suction drains excess saliva. There are no shots or drilling needed and patients will commonly relax to Nitrous Oxide gas combined with listening to music during the procedure. Significant color changes are commonly apparent after even the first visit.</p>
<p>Office bleaching is preferable to home bleaching because of the convenience for the patient and fast results. A main reason for better results with office bleaching is due of the duration that the bleach is in direct contact with the teeth. When someone puts bleach in a home bleaching tray and then puts that tray in their mouth most of that bleach is immediately pushed out of the tray and either spit out or sometimes even swallowed. Very little actually remains in the bleaching tray, and the amount that does remain is diluted by saliva. In contrast, the amount of bleach applied to the teeth during office bleaching is carefully controlled and remains in full contact with the teeth throughout the duration of the visit, with nothing being swallowed due to the suction in the mouth of the patient.</p>
