    <p> Periodontics or gum therapy, treats bad breath, swollen and/or bleeding gums and a bad taste in the mouth that is caused by bacterial infection. A Periodontist is the dental specialist who commonly treats gum disease.</p>
<p>Many patients are mistaken in their belief that dental cleanings by professionals aren't necessary or sufficient for this kind of work. The truth is the skills of individual hygienists vary as greatly as those of dentists and high volume offices will typically schedule patients in 15Â¨C30 minute time slots, whereas premium practices will typically schedule patients for one hour. If bacteria is left behind after a poorly performed cleaning then the ravages of tooth decay and gum disease may progress unnoticed by the naked eye and patients may only begin to notice years after the damage has occurred. A Periodontist should be available to diagnose these problems early on, especially since most dentists fail to diagnose gum disease.</p>
<p>A combination of early gum disease diagnosis, early preventive therapy and bacterial cultures with species-specific antibiotic regimens should dramatically reduce the need for gum surgery in a premium, conservative periodontal practice. If a patient still needs gum surgery, the previous preventive care  noted above should significantly reduce the amount of teeth involved within a procedure. </p><p>
There has been a lot of recent press regarding the relationship between periodontal and cardiovascular (heart) and other diseases. It is logical that the presence of constant bacterial infection anywhere in your body is unhealthy and therefore, there is a lot of truth to this and is one reason why many specialists have been obtaining periodontal bacterial cultures of patients for the last couple decades.</p>
